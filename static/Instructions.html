        <h3>Mac OSX</h3>
        <p>On Mac OSX sometimes you will get 32-bit/64-bit architecture errors. This is an unresolved problem still.</p>

        <h3>Linux/Unix</h3>
        <p>Certain packages may be needed to download in order for the full wxPython set of tools (Qt? GTK?)</p>

        <h2>Description of Task</h2>
        <p>The objective is to take government issue Medicaid forms and turn them into usable HTML web pages with form input fields.
        To do this, we use the software Form Creator. It allows you to choose sections which will add input fields over an image,
        then save the file to an HTML page to be used on the web, with all name/ID tagging done automatically.</p>

        <p>The software includes features used in creating web pages as well as a few ways of editing the form to prevent mistakes.</p>

        <h3>Form Creator requirements</h3>

        <p>Form Creator was created using Python with the wxPython library on a Windows operating system. The wxPython library extends
        to operating systems like OSX and Linux, but have not been tested fully. To install both Python and wxPython, just go to their
        web pages and obtain the respective download files pertaining to your system.</p>

        <h2>Stesp for Conversion</h2>

        <h3>Obtaining the PDFs</h3>

        <p>First you have to obtain the forms required for Medicaid. You have to search by state using keyword searches and find
        a PDF download (or other format like Word), then continue to download it.</p>


        <h3>Converting to PNG format</h3>

        <p>The most appropriate web graphic format is PNG. JPEG is acceptable too, but PNG has the overall highest quality.
        The next step is to converting an entire PDF into PNG format. To do this we can use ImageMagick and GhostScript.
        GhostScript comes with a tool called "convert.exe", which we will use to batch-convert the PDF into several images.</p>

        <p>Drag the PDF into a new folder, open up a terminal, then punch in this command: (Windows only)</p>

        <p style="font-family:courier;">convert -density 300 pdf-to-convert.pdf pdf-to-convert.png</p>

        <p>and this will start converting the PDF into several PNG files with a DPI (dots per inch) of 300. This process takes a while
        based on the CPU of the computer, so just wait. Optionally, find all forms and convert them in one go.</p>

        <p>Afterwards, you have to ensure that the image has a fair size in form creation. The recommended width for veritcal
        forms is 1600 pixels wide, while the recommended width for horizontal forms is 2100 pixels wide. Use an image editing
        program to do this part.</p>

        <p>Additionally, some images may require minor editing as the convert.exe tool isn't always accurate. Sometimes you will
        get a lot of extra blank space that needs to get cropped, so be prepared to use a Crop tool to clean the image.</p>

        <h3>Using Form Creator</h3>

        <p>Launch Form Creator, and you'll be brought to a window. Click on the top bar to explore several program options.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>File</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open - Open up an image to start working on</li>
                    <li>Save - Save the file and it's metadata to HTML</li>
                    <li>Close - Close the file buffer wihout saving</li>
                    <li>Export - Load a JSON file to export the data to HTML (developer only)</li>
                    <li>Print - Print information to a separate window as plaintext (not done)</li>
                    <li>About - Basic information about the program</li>
                    <li>Stats - Statistics of the current loaded file</li>
                    <li>Exit - Exit the program without saving any progress</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Edit</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filter - Delete data too small to be usable</li>
                        <li>Clean - Delete data that was not tagged properly</li>
                        <li>Delete - Delete current selection (mouse shortcut is middle click)</li>
                        <li>Delete All - Delete all items (dangerous, no Undo)</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <p>When saving an image, you will choose a file name, and the program will create a separate directory for it with three files.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The original image used in the application</li>
            <li>The new HTML file with a form to be used on the web</li>
            <li>Metadata regarding the layout of the form (called an RMAP file)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An RMAP file (or rectangular mapping file) is layout data generated from your work in the program. When you open up previous
        work on forms, it will look for an RMAP file to generate your work. When saving to an HTML page, the program will use the RMAP
        data to create a web layout automatically using CSS positioning (if you inspect an HTML page, you will see a lot of CSS).</p>

        <h3>Using Form Creator</h3>

        <p>Load up an image, and try out these controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Left-click to drag and create a new field</li>
            <li>Right-click to pan around the image on the screen</li>
            <li>Left-click on a selection to highlight it</li>
            <li>When highlighted, use middle-click to delete and remove the field</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you create fields, the next step is to applying two more things in order to make it valid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typing in a name to give the field an ID and a Name property</li>
            <li>Checking off what type of Field you created was</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, all fields you create have no name, and are by default a type of "text" field. Upon selection, you
        will automatically be focused on the text window to type a name for the field, and changing the type of field is just one click.
        The type of field can either be "text", "checkbox", or "radio" as seen in the lower-right corner. Just press on one of the text items
        to change what your field selection is.</p>

        <h3>Name/ID Text Formatting</h3>
        <p>When doing nametagging, it is well advised you follow a certain format when naming fields.</p>
        <p>Let's say for exmaple, we are creating a field over something for a "First Name", so in the name box, you should type in
        "firstName". By standard we use lowercases for first letters, and when a second word comes in we start using capitalization. Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Home Address" should be "homeAddress"</li>
            <li>"Mailing City" should be "mailingCity"</li>
            <li>"E-mail Address" should be "emailAddress"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Try to avoid using special characters !@#$%^&*(){}[]-=+_,./?";': and stick to using plaintext lowercase and uppercase.</p>
        <p>There are some special cases where we can't use one field to cover all data. Social Security fields are often put into three
        separate fields, so you must create three separate fields for Social Security. In this case, we can use our own naming
        format for this situation. When naming the three different fields, call them "socialFirst"
        "socialMiddle", and "socialLast"</p>
        <p>Another thing is when the form associates certain fields to another individual, or a person who's information differs from the one
        filling out the form, such as another person who lives in the household of the individual. In this case, we need to assert who the person
        is in regards to the main individual. To do this we can use "othersPerson" in front of all names. Example if we have say Other Person 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Other Person 2's Last Name is now "otherPerson2LastName"</li>
            <li>Other Person 2's first phone number digits is now "otherPerson2phoneFirst"</li>
            <li>Other Person 2's last social digits is now "otherPerson2socialLast"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Managing Completed Forms</h3>
        <p>When done with a page, or an entire form, bundle it up in one directory and upload it to a Git repository.
        Here's an idea of how directories should be formatted:</p>
        <p style="font-family:courier;">/ProjectDirectory/StateName/Page&lt;number&gt;/</p>

        <p>Sometimes states have different applications per-county, so create a new folder just with the county
        name attached next to StateName, as to consider it a different application.</p>
